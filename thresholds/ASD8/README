Dear Sasha,

    The data which is crucial for you are in three columns:
first column - chip number
second column - channel number 
third column - Udc in mV

The fourth one consists equivalent noise charge (ENC) which should be
useless for you so far. It is NOT a Qdc value.
Two other parameters you asked for (bottom 
of the first column) are not interested as well.  

I hope this will help you,

Best regards,

Krzysztof & Janusz

	Dear Krzysztof,
	
	I have more questions. It is about the ASD0xxxx.DAT files.
	
	  

		        An example file looks as following (Asd01001.dat)
		
		1001    1     11.6    1370.6
		1001    2    -28.6    1363.2
		1001    3    -191.3    1358.5
		1001    4    -23.8    1371.4
		1001    5    136.6    1345.7
		1001    6    -56.9    1365.2
		6832    7     11.3    1367.2
		3403    8    -82.7    1381.1
		
		First column:   first six numbers:  chip number,
		                seventh number: difference between highes and lowest 
		value of Qdc in electrons
		               eighth  number: difference between a mean value of Qdc 
		for a chip  and lowest value (in electrons)
		
		Third column:   voltage offset Udc  [mV]
		
		Fourth column:  ENC [e]
		    

	
	So I take the function mensioned in the COMPASS Note 2000-10, fig.4
	and it depends on Q and 3 parameters U(Q;U0,k,Qdc).
	
	You used 1-point solution (it is mentioned in the 2000-10 COMPASS Note). 
	And I assume you measure one value per channel (Qdc) plus some 
	measuremnts per chip (like 6832 and 3403 for Asd01001.dat).
	
	From the Note I take (am I right with that?):
	U0 = 1628 mV
	k  = 304 mV/fC
	
	And from your files I have Qdc (the forth column). At this point I 
	know the function U(Q) for all channels of ASD8 chips.
	
	But now I don't undertsnad the contents of the third column of the DB. It 
	is mentioned in the note that Udc=-Qdc*k. But this is definitely not true
	in your files. Even the sign of Udc may change! And why do you have both 
	Udc and Qdc in the files?
	
	What did I miss?
	
	Do I need to use
	- difference between highes and lowest value of Qdc in electrons
	- difference between a mean value of Qdc for a chip  and lowest value (in electrons)
	?
	
	Thanks in advance,
	Sasha.
