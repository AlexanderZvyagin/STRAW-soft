\section{Terminology}
You are advised to skip this section in a first reading and refer to it later,
if you need to.
\subsubsection*{V-plot}
Set of $m$ points $[\delta_i;\tau_i],\;\;i=1\dots m$; where $\delta$ is drift
distance (the sortest distance between a track and the sense wire) and $\tau$
is drift time associated with it.
\subsubsection*{RT-relation}
Function which connects drift distance with drift time. A usual
question which you want to ask from a RT-relation is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is a drift distance $\delta$ for a given drift time $\tau$?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{$T_0$}
In the given report $T_0$ is the smallest possible time measurement from a
channel. All time measurements which are smaller then $T_0$ should be
considered as a channel noise.
\subsubsection*{Card}
Electronic card which is used to read out up to 64 channels of a STRAW
drift chamber.
\subsubsection*{DL}
Double layer - full detector (10mm and 6mm straws, upstream and downstream layers).

\subsubsection*{PH (region)}
Physical hole (region).

\subsubsection*{CORAL}
COMPASS reconstruction program.

\section{Description of the problem}
\label{ch:Problem description}
The layout of STRAW drift chambers in the 2004 data taking period was the following.
There were two ST03 submodules (combined in one module) and three submodules
ST04,ST05,ST06. So in total there were five submodules. Every submodule consists
of three detectors (or DL): one Y-type and two X-types. To readout a Y-type detector
11 cards and for a X-type detector 14 cards are needed.
So in total, to read out all STRAW drift chambers (15 DLs)
$195 = 5 \times (11 + 2 \times 14)$ cards are needed
\footnote{In the plots below one can see that the number of cards is less then 195.
It happens because
\begin{itemize}
\item there were some detectors with missing cards;
\item some cards did not work properly in a give time period.
\end{itemize}}.

A single card can readout up to a 64
channels in total. {\bf We assume that all 64 channels of the same card have identical
$T_0$ values}. Every card has its own cable which connectes it to
the COMPASS DAQ system. And these cable lengths are not necessarily equal.
So in principle, every card may have a $T_0$ which differs
from the others and in total we may have 195 different $T_0$ for all cards.
The cable lengths were adjusted in such a way, that cards of the same submodule
had the same $T_0$. This assumption (one $T_0$ for one detector) was used in
the COMPASS reconstruction program (CORAL). But one can impove the detector
resolution seen by CORAL by making a card-dependent $T_0$ calibration.
In the given report the method and results of per-card $T_0$ calibration
are described.

\section{Procedure of T0 calibration}
\subsection{RT-relation}
First of all, RT-relation is determined (this procedure is not described here).
The RT function is calculated by fitting a V-plot of a reasonable quality
\footnote{A V-plot for the RT-fit procedure does not need to be perfect. V-legs may be fat
(due to a bad resolution), the V-plot background may be big, but as far as the plot
has enough entries, the RT function determination is not a problem.}.
The RT used by STRAW drift chambers is given by a table-function,
see tables (\ref{RT6mm}) and (\ref{RT10mm}). The drift distance $\delta$ for a drift
time $\tau$ is calculated by linear interpolation between points $[t_i;t_{i+1}]$
of the table, with $t_i \leq \tau<t_{i+1}$.

\subsection{V-plots of cards}
A V-plot is fitted by the fixed RT function presented in the table (\ref{RT6mm}) or (\ref{RT10mm}),
depending on the straw diameter size.
The fit gives two numbers $w_0$ and $T_0$ which
determine origin of the V. Here we are only intrested in the
variation of $T_0$.

%The value $w_0$ is not intresting for the present
%study \footnote{It tells us about detector misalignment.}.
%And $T_0$ is the number which we are intresting in.

A single X- or Y- type detector has an internal structure of an
{\it upstream} and {\it downstream} layer. A single electronic card
reads both of them. One half
of a card (32 channels) reads a part of an upstream layer and another half reads
a downstream one. For every card the two V-plots are created: one for the
upstream and another for the  downstream layers. So after a V-plot fit,
two $T_0$ numbers available:
$T_0^u$ and $T_0^d$. Because we assume that possible $T_0$ variations
among cards are due to different cable lengths and every card has a single readout cable,
these $T_0^u$ and $T_0^d$ values should be identical.
In reality they are different, because of the statistical fluctuations and
some systematic effects. Distribution of the difference $T_0^u - T_0^d$
plotted for all cards gives a very good hint about the method precision
$\sigma_{T_0}$ of $T_0$ determination
\footnote{One have to assume that $\sigma_{T_0}$ is the same for all cards.
In principle this is not correct. The method of $T_0$ calculation is sensetive to
the number of V-plot entries, but the amount of data comming from different cards
is very different (by a factor $1\dots10^5$). Apparently this is
not a problem - the distribution $T_0^u - T_0^d$ has a nice gaussian shape
(see Figure (\ref{T0u-T0d distr proj})),
so the hypothesis about stable $\sigma_{T_0}$ works.}.
The distribution of $T_0^u - T_0^d$ difference plotted
on all analyzed cards is shown on the Figures (\ref{T0u-T0d distr}) and (\ref{T0u-T0d distr proj}).
From the $\sigma$ value
of the gaussian fit one can determinate the precision of $T_0$
determination:
$$\sigma_{T_0} = \frac{\sigma_{fit}}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
It is approximately equal to $\sigma_{T_0} = \frac{0.22 ns}{\sqrt{2}} = 0.16 ns$
The number of cards covered by the fit is given by the formula
$\frac{A \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma}{\delta_{bin}}$,
where $A$ and $\sigma$ are the numbers from the ROOT fit and $\delta_{bin}$ is the bin size
of the histogram. So with the numbers $A=24$, $\sigma=0.22\;ns$, $\delta_{bin}=0.1\;ns$
we found that the fit covers $\frac{A \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma}{\delta_{bin}} \approx 132$ cards
out of 180.

%The table (\ref{T0 card fit problems}) contains a list of cards for which
%$T_0^u$ and $T_0^d$ did not agree, $|T_0^u - T_0^d|>1\;ns$.
%A typical V-fit problems are shown on the figures (\ref{fig:fit problem - noise}),
%(\ref{fig:fit problem - no data}),
%(\ref{fig:fit problem - bad data}), (\ref{fig:fit problem - fit disagrees}),
%(\ref{fig:fit problem - fit failed}).

\section{V-plot fitting parameters}
\subsection{V-fit program parameters description}
\label{sec:V-fit parameters}
Here the function used in the fitting procedure is described.
The C++ code of it is provided in the appendix (\ref{sec:minimization function}).

The fitting code (MINUIT) tried to minimize a function $F$ (described below)
which depends on the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item V-plots data, this is a set of $m$ points $[\delta_i;\tau_i],\;\;i=1\dots m$;
\item RT;
\item $w_0$;
\item $T_0$.
\end{itemize}

If a V-plot data point has $\tau_i<T_0$ or $\tau_i>T_0+\tau_{max}$ (where $\tau_{max}$ is a
maximum drift time, obtained from the RT) then this point does not contribute to $F$. If a point
$(\delta_i;\tau_i)$ is too far from a V-leg, it is ignored (parameter $\delta_{leg}$ below).
A point will be ignored also if it is in the V-plot central region (parameter $\delta_{center}$ below).
This has been done because the central region of a V-plot is badly described by RT.

All accepted points $m^\prime$ $(\delta_i;\tau_i)$ are added to the $F$ function:
\footnote{This is a principle formula. The real code is a little bit more complex, because
a possible detector misalgnment should be taken into account, see section (\ref{sec:minimization function}).}

$$
    F = \sum_{i=1}^{m^\prime}{(\delta_i-\delta_i^{RT}(\tau_i))^2}
$$

where $\delta_i^{RT}(\tau_i)$ is the predicted drift distance obtained from the
RT for a given $\tau_i$.

Here is the list of tunable parameters which effect the $F$ function calculation:
\begin{description}
\item[$\delta_{leg}$] Maximum distance from a RT-leg to a data point;
\item[$\delta_{center}$] All central points points of a V-plot with $|\delta_i|<\delta_{center}$
                         do not contribute to $F$.
\item[$K_{points}$]   The final $F$ function is multiplied by a factor $1+K_{points}\frac{m-m^\prime}{m+m^\prime}$,
                      where $m^\prime$ is the number of points which contributed to the function $F$ calculation.
                      This has been done to encourage the fit procedure to fit as many points of V-plot
                      as possible. $$ F_{final} = F \times \left(1+K_{points}\frac{m-m^\prime}{m+m^\prime} \right).$$
\end{description}

\subsection{V-fit program parameters tuning}
As it was explained earlier, the $T_0^u-T_0^d$ distribution Figure (\ref{T0u-T0d distr proj})
plotted for many cards
provides a measure of $T_0$ method precision $\sigma_{T_0}$. One can use this plot to decide
which set of parameters of the section (\ref{sec:V-fit parameters}) produces the best results.
To judge about how well fit worked with a set of $(\delta_{leg},\delta_{center},K_{points})$
parameters one can look to some values of a corresponding $T_0^u-T_0^d$ distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item RMS - root mean squre of the distribution in the histogram range;
\item $\sigma$ from the Gaus fit;
\item Number of cards described by the Gaus fit (integral of the Gaus distribution).
\end{itemize}

Results of the such investigation can be found in the Table (\ref{tbl:fit tuning}).

\section{Measured $T_0^u$ and $T_0^d$ for all cards}

%\subsection{How results are presented}
In this section you will find the results on all calculated $T_0$ values.
The results are presented in the set of tables and plots. There is one plot and
one table for every DL.

\subsection{Analyzed data}
It was analyzed run number 37059 with the CORAL version from June 2005. Corrections
from X-ray tables were activated, but CORAL clusters were not updated by the X-ray
corrections (internal CORAL feature). A simplified alignment of STRAW chambers was
done as well.

\subsection{Plots and tables description}
On the plots you will find the distribution of
$T_0^u$ and $T_0^d$ versus card number of a DL.
On the plots and tables, the cards numbers appear in the following order:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10mm cards on the Saleve side (for {\bf XUV} types) or
from the bottom part (for {\bf Y} type) of a chamber, the ordering
is Saleve $\rightarrow$ Jura for {\bf XUV} chamber types and
bottom $\rightarrow$ top for the {\bf Y}-type.
\item 6mm cards before the PH region, the ordering is Saleve $\rightarrow$ Jura
      ({\bf XUV}-type) or bottom $\rightarrow$ top ({\bf Y}-type);
\item Card of the PH region which is located on the same side as other cards;
\item Card of the PH region which is located alone on another side of the detector;
\item 6mm cards after the PH region, the ordering is Saleve $\rightarrow$ Jura
      ({\bf XUV}-type) or bottom $\rightarrow$ top ({\bf Y}-type);
\item 10mm cards on the Jura side (for {\bf XUV} chamber types) or
from the top part (for {\bf Y} chamber type) of a chamber, the ordering
is Saleve $\rightarrow$ Jura for {\bf XUV} chamber types and
bottom $\rightarrow$ top for the {\bf Y}-type.
\end{itemize}

One bin of a histogram correspond to one half of a card.
The bin labels have the follwoing format: $$<straw size>-<layer>-<card ID>$$
where $<straw size>$ is either $6mm$ or $10mm$, $<layer>$ is 
{\bf u} for upstream and {\bf d} for downstream layer and $<card ID>$
is the card identification number
\footnote{For the {\it card identification number} there is another name:
{\it card geoghraphical address}. In fact
this is not an address of a card. This is an address of a motherboard to which
a card is connected. So if you replace a card in a certain place of a DL to
a new one, the newly placed card ID will be exactly the same as for the previous card.}.
A possible prefix PH says that this card is from a DL physical hole region,
and it is located on a few meters distance away from other non-PH cards.
There are 22 entries (two times the number of cards)
for {\bf Y}-type and 28 for the {\bf XUV}-type detectors,
see Section \ref{ch:Problem description}.

Description of the tables columns:
\begin{description}
\item[card] The card name. It is the same as for the plots.
\item[layer] Upstream (u) or downstream (d) latyer.
\item[data] Number of points in an appropriate V-plot.
\item[$T_0$] The value of $T_0$ which was obtained from a V-plot fit.
\item[$T_0^c$] This is a $T_0$ which will be used in software, {\it calibrated $T_0$}.
A number given in the brackets $<T_0>$ means that the $T_0^c$ was calculated as
the average $$T_0^c=\frac{T_0^u+T_0^d}{2}.$$ This is done for all cases when V-fit worked
on the both layers. If $T_0^c$ value is given without brackets (fit problems or V-plot problems),
then $T_0^c$ is taken from one of the neighbor cards.
\item[comment] Fit result comment. The comment {\bf OK} means that I have
looked at the V-plots and they were fine. And there is no any comment
if I did not look at the V-plots.
\end{description}

\subsection{Necessity of the per-card $T_0$ calibration.}
In the {\bf CORAL} COMPASS reconstruction program it is used 6 $T_0$ values for every DL, one
$T_0^{CORAL}$ for every DL subsection.
If $T_0^{C_i}$ is a $T_0$ value obtained for a card $i$ in this subsection by the present
calibration procedure, then
the difference $T_0^{C_i}-T_0^{CORAL}$ (ploted for all DL subsections)
will tell us how much one can gain by applying per-card $T_0$ calibration.
Looking at the plot Figure (\ref{fig:coral_t0_diff}) one can see that the spread of
$T_0$-values is $\approx 1.3 ns$ which corresponds to $130 \mu m$ and is comparable with
the chamber resolution.

\section{Conclusions}

The precision of our  method  to determine T0 is
$<0.2 ns$. With a  drift velocity of $\approx 100\mu m /ns$ it corresponds to $20\mu m$
spatial resolution. This precision is good enough to study the effects of the $T_0$
calibration on the overall  spatial resolution.
%of  240 microm (design goal for one chamber layer).
The quality of the V-plots varies much from one detector to another. We suspect that this happens
due to a different quality of tracking at the detector positions.
There were several cases where the V-fit did not well, but for majority number of cards
the results are satisfactory.

In the course of the  work described here, several software bugs were discovered.
 
Our main result is the measurement of the fluctuations of $T_0$  for different readout cards,
see Figure (\ref{fig:coral_t0_diff_det}) and Figure (\ref{fig:coral_t0_diff}).
They show that $T_0$ varies by up to 3 ns from the mean value  and the CORAL $T_0$ determined
for one DL subsection, in  some cases  even up to 14 ns. Thus the necessity to obtain an
individual $T_0$ calibration per card has been demonstrated. At presnt, the contribution to the
spatial resolution due to the lack of an individual calibration per card is estimated to
be $130 \mu m$.
