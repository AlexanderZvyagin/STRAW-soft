/*! \mainpage COMPASS Detector Slow Control Monitoring
    \author Alexander Zvyagin <Alexander.Zviagine@cern.ch>
    \section ThePurpose The purpose
    The COMPASS DCS system works very nice now (2004 year). It provides
    an easy access to a detector slow control information. But sometimes
    we need to make a global overview of a detector slow control properties
    over a certain time period. For example: how many times a detector tripped?
    Did it hold nominal high voltage in that period of time?
    The present tool helps to find an answeres to these kind of questions.

    \section MakeReport How to Create a Report
        \verbatim
        $ dcs --t1="2006-11-1 00:00:00" --t2="2006-11-11 00:00:00"
        \endverbatim
    
    \section FillDB How to Fill the DB
     - First of all you have to login on computer \b pccompass07 under account
       \b dcs. You have to know the password for this, ask the DCS group.
     - After that please run the following command:
       \verbatim
       $ /afs/cern.ch/compass/detector/straw/bin/cs shell
       \endverbatim
       It will spawn a new shell with correct environment variables.
     - Now you can extract data from internal DCS database to ordinary text files.
       \verbatim
       $ straw_dcs_files
       \endverbatim
       A window should be opend on your display.
       - Select a time period for which you want to extract data. It is OK if
         your time period overlaps with a previous one (if you run the program
         more then once). In the MySQL DB you will not have any duplicated entries.
         - Select \c IMon and press \c Start. A new window will popup.
         - Press \c Yes and wait for 5..30 minutes for the message \b Status: \c Done.
         - Then press \c Close on the subwindow.
         - At this moment you should have extracted all current measurements for
         your detector from the DB.
       - Repeat the same exersice with other fields (Vmon,Humidity,...)
       You can also try to use non-graphical scrip-oriented version of the program:
       \verbatim
       $ straw_dcs_files2
       \endverbatim
     - Now go the directory with the output files.
       \verbatim
       $ cd /dcs/home/data/xls_report
       $ ls -la
       \endverbatim
       You will see all files which should have been produced.
       Check the files creation time!
     - The next step is to copy the newly extracted data from the output files to
       MySQL DB. You can do this with this command:
       \verbatim
       $ dcs --db-files=/dcs/home/data/xls_report --db-user=NAME --db-password=COMPASS-PASSWORD
       \endverbatim
       Please specify your name for the --user argument and use COMPASS standard password.
       The program may run for hours, if size of your data is big enough (~1Gb).
       Don't worry if you see something like:
       \verbatim
       **** FAILED: INSERT INTO ..... Error in <TMySQLServer::Query>: Duplicate entry ....
       \endverbatim
     - Once the program finished it work, you have successfully updated the DB.
